Ness Computing ActiveMQ Service
===============================

This is the ness message queueing system based on Apache ActiveMQ.

It generally is deployed as a Galaxy tarball and provides message bus
services for the rest of the platform.

Configuration
-------------

As ActiveMQ requires quite a bit of configuration, a set of
configuration which also loads the plugins is included in the "conf"
folder.
